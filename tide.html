          The Tide Background App is an app I created for my android phone based on the Tide Motivational App. Every morning, I enjoy looking at their daily quote. This app, manually or automatically, will change your phone background to the quote and image that they put on Twitter.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, three days about I finished the working version of the app, the Tide Twitter stopped posting their quotes, rendering this app useless. Still, it is a good example of a basic android app with web scraping.
