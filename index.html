          Hello World! My name is Jonathan Rivard but my friends call me John. I
          am a senior in high school and I plan to go to North Dakota State
          University for Computer Science. I love programming robots and
          creating applications to make life easier.

            My main hobby is programming. My favorite part of every project is
            the learning and ambition that begins it and the insight that
            follows. Public projects I’ve completed range from web design to app
            development to robotics. I am incredibly excited to see where my
            passion and curiosity will take me next!

            I am the lead programmer for Team 6045. We are a relatively small,
            3rd year team that just had a large influx of aspiring programmers.
            Most of my time this year will be spent mentoring to these new team
            members.

            Another thing I love to do is tell a story through film. While I’m
            fond of editing videos, it doesn’t stop me from getting out and
            shooting video myself or helping a friend with their project. I’ve
            shot and edited two promotional videos for a local band as well as
            working numerous video essays for school projects.

              My favorite part of computer science is that there is always more
              to learn.
