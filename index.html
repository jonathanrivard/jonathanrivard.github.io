                    <p>Character Tracker is a web application made to keep track of base statistics in a group of players in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. To make this possible, I used Javascript ES6 for the first time. It includes functionality to dynamically add players and their stats to the page, as well as saving and loading them from browser storage.</p>
