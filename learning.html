          My favorite part of computer science is that there is always more to
          learn. In the interest of this, I’m listing some of the projects I’ve
          made that I used as learning exercises. While it makes me cringe a
          little to look at my previous skills, it also excites me to see how
          far I have come and how far I have yet to go.

            The Loot Brothers is a website I made for a joke and practice. It is
            the first website I made and let me apply my newly earned frontend
            knowledge. It is based on a fictional medieval company in a Dungeons
            and Dragons campaign.

            The Triangle Auto Solver website is an online application I created
            during a Pre-Calc class to check the multitude of "solve the
            triangle" problems we had to do. Enter any three givens of a
            triangle and the calculator will give you the other three.

            Character Tracker is a web application made to keep track of base
            statistics in a group of players in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.
            To make this possible, I used Javascript ES6 for the first time. It
            includes functionality to dynamically add players and their stats to
            the page, as well as saving and loading them from browser storage.
